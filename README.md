 🔍 Crime Data Analysis
 
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes crime data using Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data processing and Tableau for data visualization. The goal is to identify trends, patterns, and insights from crime records to support better decision-making.

📂 Dataset

Source:  Kaggle - Crimes in India

Format: Excel ( convert to CSV)

Key Columns:

Crime_Type – Type of crime (e.g., Theft, Assault, Fraud)

Location – City or area where the crime occurred

Date – Date of occurrence

Time – Time of the crime

Victim_Age – Age of the victim (if available)

Suspect_Gender – Gender of the suspect (if available)

Case_Status – Whether the case is Open / Solved

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas – For data manipulation

numpy – For numerical operations

Visualization:

Tableau – For creating interactive dashboards

IDE: Visual Studio Code

📊 Key Insights & Visualizations

Crime trends over time (yearly, monthly, daily analysis)

Most affected locations and crime hotspots

Crime distribution by type and category

Victim demographics analysis (age, gender, etc.)

Case resolution status visualization

🚀 How to Run

Install Dependencies: pip install pandas numpy

Run Python Scripts:

Open Visual Studio Code, load the dataset, and execute Python scripts to clean and preprocess data.

Visualization in Tableau:

Import the cleaned dataset into Tableau

Create dashboards for crime insights

📌 Future Enhancements
